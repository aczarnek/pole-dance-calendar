# **Pole-dance calendar**

Pole Dance Calendar is an application that provides information about various pole dancing events. Intended to be a one-place access to pole dancing events taking place globally, the application solves the problem of having to check various websites or social media platforms to stay updated about events. In the current state however, it only consists of events hosted in Poland. These events could be championships, workshops or in other formats.
The application is designed to have responsive design and hence functions well on devices such as mobiles, laptops and tablets as well.
